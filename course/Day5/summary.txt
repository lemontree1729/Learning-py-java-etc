21/10/12 java lesson

* What I learned(Important) : 
  - How to download eclipse(IDE) and java : JUST DOWNLOAD IT!
    # you could see information of java like version, etc...
  - How to set PATH(environment variable) :
   1. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - 새로 만들기 - type name and location of jdk folder(you should include jdk folder)
     # this declares name of file path(location)
   2. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - double click Path - new - type location of bin in jdk folder(you should include bin folder)
     # you could do this with typing %(name)%\bin with name that you declared at 1.
  - What is java?
    # WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere) : doesn't matter what CPU and OS you use
      java uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and Bytecode(binary code that you can only run with JVM)
      and this makes java as platform independent language
  - IDE(Integrated Development Environment) : edit, compile, debug with same progrem
    # plus a lot of tools to use. ex) correct simple wrong syntax
  - (file) Hello.java
    # Basic Structure of java code
  - (file) Hello2030.java
    # What happens when we print out standard output


* What I studied myself :
  - How to make javadoc : cmd javadoc (java_file_name) at java file path to create javadoc
    # We can overview the java_file but not that effective
  - (file) Howtoinput.java
    # Show how to do standard input with java
    # There are other methods that works almost same but using scanner method is way easyer than other method
  - (file) Scannererr.java (Learning)
    # about nonsence happend when using nextInt with nextLine method in Scanner


* What I didn't understand : 
- What is different between download packages(Java Developers, Eclips Committers.. etc)
- What is difference between IDE, jdk and jre?
- What is java API exactly?


* What I want to know more : 
- MarkDown syntax 
- Where is java class library file? 
- How to open JAVADOC? (Solved)
- What is JaCoCo(Java Code Coverage)? 
- How to do standard input? (Solving)


4. etc(Additional) : 
  - How to change dark mode : open eclipse - Window - preferences - Geeral - Appearance - Theme - Dark
  - How to see cmd command of java : open cmd - type javac
  - Asemble with cmd "javac Hello.java", dissasemble with cmd "javap -c Hello > Helloc.bc"
