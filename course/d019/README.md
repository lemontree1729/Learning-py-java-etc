# 21/11/01 Java lesson

## What I learned(Important)

* [What is class?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html)
* What is class array? ([BookArray.java](BookArray.java))
  *
* What is reference type and primitive type?
  * Reference type ([Circle.java](Circle.java))
    * class that is mutable
    * when the value is changed, it's memory address don't need to be changed
  * Primitive type
    * when the value is changed, it's memory address should be changed to changed values memory address pointer

## What I studied myself

## What I didn't understand

* (in [BookArray.java](BookArray.java)) Why already declared variable moves to different memory address for each value change?
* Is there any difference with only value add and value add with declare variable?

## What I want to know more
