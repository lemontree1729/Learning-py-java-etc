* What I learned(Important) : 
  - (file) display.html : difference of inline, inline-block, block in display tag and float tag
    # inline : act as letter. if you define size more than contents, outer part just goes to padding.
    # inline-block : act as letter. but can define sertain width and height.
    # block : act as full-viewpoint-width box. if you define size, left width just goes to margin.
    # float : similar with inline-block but cant text-align.
               you should give margin with child or padding with parent.
               and parent can't recognize size of float object, you should give overflow: hidden to parent
               (adding more info, the exact mechanism is parent don't know exact float child's position)

    # type <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, inital-scale=1.0" /> in <head>

    # using @media(media quarry), set max-width as @media (max-width: ???px)
