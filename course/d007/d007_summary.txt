* What I learned(Important) : 
  - How to download eclipse(IDE) and java : JUST DOWNLOAD IT!
    # you could see information of java like version, etc...
  - How to set PATH(environment variable) :
   1. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - 새로 만들기 - type name and location of jdk folder(you should include jdk folder)
     # this declares name of file path(location)
   2. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - double click Path - new - type location of bin in jdk folder(you should include bin folder)
     # you could do this with typing %(name)%\bin with name that you declared at 1.
  - What is java?
    # WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere) : doesn't matter what CPU and OS you use
      java uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and Bytecode(binary code that you can only run with JVM)
      and this makes java as platform independent language




* What I did't understand : 
- What is different between download packages(Java Developers, Eclips Committers.. etc
- What is difference between IDE, jdk and jre?



* What I want to know more : 
- MarkDown syntax
