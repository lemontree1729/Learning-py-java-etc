# 21/11/15 JavaScript lesson

## What I learned(Important)

* What is JavaScript?
  * used to make dynamic contents in web service
  * script language(Not an markup language like html)

* how to declare variables
  * `var $variable-name$`: can declare exact same name variable. so recommands to use with global variable declare
  * `let $variable-name$`: make error when exact same name variable already exists.
  * `const $variable-name$`: declare constant variable. can't define without initializing and can't change the value
* template literal: almost same as f-string in python.
  * use `${variable-name}` to enter exact value to string

* [types in javascript](https://jinbroing.tistory.com/49?category=701256)

    * null
    * undefined: variable's value that doesn't initialized value

    * Boolean type
