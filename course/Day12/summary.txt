* What I learned(Important) : 
  - if else statement
    # 


* What I studied myself :
  (more information with http://blog.naver.com/sharon0a/110046003657)
  - RDBMS(Relational DataBase Management System)
    # can define only simple things like word, number, date and can't make new type
    # using SQL(Structured Query Language)
  - ORDBMS(Object-Relational DataBase Management System)
    # can define new type by user
    # using extended SQL
    # slower then RDBMS dealing with data(searching, adding, ...etc)
  - OODBMS(Object-Oriented DataBase Management System)
    # can define new type and method by user
    # using OQL(Object Query Language)
    # a lot more slower then RDBMS dealing with data(searching, adding, ...etc)
  - ORM(Object Relational Mapping)
    # Used to map between OOP(Object Oriented Programming) and RDBMS
    # I guess OODBMS doesn't need to use ORM


* What I didn't understand : 


* What I want to know more : 
  - making web system with Nginx(Web Server), Gunicorn(WSGI, same as Web Server Gateway Interface,
    Django(WAS, same as Web Application Server) refer to https://pythonblog.co.kr/blog/61/
      # more exact imformation is in https://jay-ji.tistory.com/66
      # will add Database with(PostgreSQL(ORDBMS) or Mysql(RDBMS))
