# 21/10/12 java lesson

## What I learned(Important)

* How to download eclipse(IDE) and java : JUST DOWNLOAD IT!
    * you could see information of java like version, etc
* How to set PATH(environment variable) :
    1. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - 새로 만들기 - type name and location of jdk folder(you should include jdk folder)
        * this declares name of file path(location)
    2. 검색 - 시스템 환경 변수 설정 - 환경 변수 - double click Path - new - type location of bin in jdk folder(you should include bin
       folder)
        * you could do this with typing %(name)%\bin with name that you declared at 1
* What is java?
    * WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere) : doesn't matter what CPU and OS you use
        * java uses JVM(Java Virtual Machine) and Bytecode(binary code that you can only run with JVM)
          and this makes java as platform independent language
    * IDE(Integrated Development Environment) : edit, compile, debug with same program
        * plus a lot of tools to use. ex) correct simple wrong syntax
* [Hello.java](Hello.java)
    * Basic Structure of java code
* [Hello2030.java](Hello2030.java)
    * What happens when we print standard output

## What I studied myself

* How to make javadoc : cmd javadoc (java_file_name) at java file path to create javadoc
    * We can overview the java_file but not that effective
* [HowToInput.java](HowToInput.java)
    * Show how to do standard input with java
    * There are other methods that works almost same but using scanner method is way easier than other method
* [ScanError.java](ScanError.java) (Learning)
    * about nonsense happened when using nextInt with nextLine method in Scanner

* What is difference between IDE, jdk and jre?
* What is java API exactly?

## What I want to know more

* Where is java class library file?
