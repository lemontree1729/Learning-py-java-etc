# 22/01/21 mongoDB Lesson

## What I learned(Important)

## What I studied myself

* oracleDB vs mongoDB
    * oracleDB:
        * can save query with .sql extension and can import it
        * so can control data without using java, javascript or etc
        * can save WAS resources
        * can make saved procedure
    * mongoDB:
        * can't save query with its own extension
        * only save queries using connected apps(javascrpit, python... etc)
        * can't make saved procedure

* how to unbind ip(allow remote access):
    * open file `$mongoDB-path$/mongod.cfg` and change

* mongoDB query
    * insertOne and insertMany
    * deleteOne and deleteMany
    *
