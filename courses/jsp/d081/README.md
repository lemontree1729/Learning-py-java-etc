# 22/01/24 JSP Lesson

## What I learned(Important)

* [static and dynamic web page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-web-pages/)
    * static web page: remain same until someone changes it manually
    * dynamic web page: can be different for different visitors
* what is JSP?
* run apache tomcat server with jsp
* [JSP tags](index.jsp)

## What I studied myself

* template engine: engine that combines two different thing
    * ex) [java template engine with html](https://www.libhunt.com/l/java/topic/template-engine): JSP, Thymeleaf,
      FreeMarker, Groovy... etc
    * ex) [python template engine with html](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating): jinja2(default of flask), Django
      template... etc

* [TCP vs UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)
    * TCP: transfer data with connection
        * response(success or fail or packet loss) occurs
        * slower but stable
    * UDP: transfer data without connection
        * we don't know transfer's status
        * faster but unstable
